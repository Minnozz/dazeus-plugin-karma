===================
dazeus-plugin-karma
===================

This directory contains the Karma plugin from DaZeus. It uses the embedded
DaZeus 2 database to store the karma properties, in the same format as the
older karma plugins. When running it, you only need to specify the socket
path (with 'unix:' or 'tcp:') as the first parameter; it will attach and
start monitoring traffic immediately.

Use the following commands to build and the application:
  qmake
  make
  ./dazeus-plugin-karma unix:dazeus.sock

If your DaZeus2 library is not in an auto-detectable location, you can give
qmake a hand:
  qmake -after "QMAKE_CXXFLAGS += -I/path/to/libdazeus-qt" \
        -after "QMAKE_LIBS += -L/path/to/libdazeus-qt -L/path/to/libdazeus/lib"
